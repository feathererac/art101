	<h1>Challenges:</h1>
	<p>
		I don't know about the prompt enough, did extra work to use the if function to check for potential 
		type errors like in Python, but I realized that there is no need to do this because the variable will 
		always be a string because we prompted it to be a string.
	</p>
	<h1>Problems:</h1>
	<p>
		I don't know how to do a type check in js, so I asked Wesbot for help, and he was great. I also defined 
		the username before the function to be an empty string, but later on, when I was trying to call it, I 
		realized the function doesn't change the variable globally before it' called so I recorded when it asks 
		for the username to get it outside of the function so I could return the original username and the sorted username.

	<h1>Results:</h1>
	<p>
		I completed the lab!
