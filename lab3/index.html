	<h1>Challenges:</h1>
	<p>It was hard to remember the difference between block element and inline element when I was really 
		trying to make something work. I had to ask chatGPT a few times why the code didn't work as I 
		intended because of the formatting issues and some tools in CSS like text-align only work on 
		block element.
	</p>
	<h1>Results:</h1>
	<p>This is the standard file structure for a collection of html labs I made:</p>
	<img id="img1" src="img/filetree.png"/>
	<p></p>
	<div class="centered-container">
		<a href="../index.html">Back to homepage</a>
	</div>
