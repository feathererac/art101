		<h1 class="labp">Lab 4 Pseudocode</h1>
		<h1>Challenges:</h1>
		<p>It was hard to plan everything out at once. My Saint and I helped each other out 
			and fixed issues we saw that didn't make sense for a pseudocode for the snake game.
		</p>
		<h1>Results:</h1>
		<p>This is the Pseudocode I made for the snake game:</p>
		<pre><code>
			//Sprites.
  				//Set up the player sprite in idle mode.
  				//Set up the AI sprite in idle mode.

			//Print player map.
  				//Lay out barriers such as walls.

			//Print player UI.
			//Lay out scores in the top left corner.

			//Accept/Validate player movement.
			//Accept player movements of moving left, right, up, and down when keys are pressed.
				//Bind left, right, up, and down animation to those keys.
			//Set player movement speed at a fixed amount.

			//Spawn new items/sprites over time
			//Set up a timer
			//Loop items drop at random positions over fixed periods of time.
				//Continue spawning new items/sprites until the player hits the wall, themselves, or they cannot continue.
			//AI:
			//Sprites move randomly.
				//Bind sprite left, right, up, and down animation to AIâ€™s movements.
			//Sprites move at a fixed amount of speed.
			//Sprites cannot move out of the boundary of walls.

			//Elongate player avatar.
			//If the player attains an item/sprite, the player elongates by 1 block.
			//The item/sprite disappears after colliding with the player.

			//Test score/loss condition. 
			//Collision detections overall:
				//Set up collision detection between the player and the sprite.
				//Set up collision detection between walls and the player.
				//Set up collision detection when the player collides with themselves.
			//Score: The player hits an item/sprite and gains 1 point.
			//Lose: The player hits a wall or themselves.
