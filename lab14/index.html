    <p>
      There were very few bugs for me to debug because most of my programs runs bug free when I submitted them. 
      It was hard to find something to debug.

      The code works fine, but an error message shows up about an already declared variable. I checked the js and nothing was wrong for lab 5/6/7. 
      Then I learned that it was not the code that was wrong, it was the section where I linked the js file twice by accident because I didn't quite 
      understand how the link worked and the difference between linking it in the head section and body section.
