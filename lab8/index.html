	<h1>Challenges:</h1>
	<p>
		It was challenging trying to understand what each task was asking for, because 
		the original document we copied from Wes's GitHub has alread included defer in 
		the head section and has defer already written in it.
	</p>
	<h1>Problems:</h1>
	<p>
		I thought the console log would work similarly to the console where it outputs the
		 result directly on the html page, but then I realized it only prints in the console. 
		 I checked out task x and it was just added defer to the link section of js so I could 
		 use $("#output").html directly in js file.
	</p>
	<h1>Results:</h1>
	<p>
		I finished the lab!
