    <p>
      The most challenging part about this lab is finding out what does what on the Pokemon API website. 
      The website was great, but there was too much information to go through, very complicated.

    <p>
      I was generating random Pokemon based on the total Pokemon count, but the website doesn't have all 
      the ones working for some reason. It was 1302 when I made the API return all the Pokemon, but according 
      to ChatGPT, the number included something that is not part of real Pokemon, which the actual count of total 
      Pokemon is 1025 under this "https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokedex/national/"
