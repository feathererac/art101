		<h1>Challenges:</h1>
		<p>
			Trying to complete the bones task within 4 lines was very challenging. 
			I thought I could just put them all in a single line and the code would 
			still work. For example, I tried to assign the 3 sections in a single 
			line and it just wouldn't work.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div id="problems" class="special-sections">
		<h1>Problems:</h1>
		<p>
			I couldn't make the code work for the bones task by just assigning 
			each class a class name “special-sections” so I did that in the HTML 
			file and made everything else work.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div id="results" class="special-sections">
		<h1>Results:</h1>
		<p>
			The lab runs bug-free and does what it is intended to do.
